        <p> Hello! My name is Jhalen S. Guadalquiver, and I am 21 years old. I am currently a second-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information System. I live in Barangay Duljo Fatima, Cebu City, where I have spent most of my life growing and learning.

            Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the world around us. My passion for computers and systems led me to choose Information Systems as my field of study. I enjoy solving problems, analyzing data, and exploring the limitless possibilities of programming and software development.
            
            Beyond academics, I love engaging in activities that challenge my creativity and critical thinking. Whether it's coding, learning about the latest tech trends, or working on personal projects, I always strive to improve my skills and knowledge.
            
            In the future, I aspire to become a successful IT professional, contributing to innovative solutions that make life easier for people. I believe that perseverance, continuous learning, and a strong work ethic will help me achieve my goals.
            
            This is just the beginning of my journey, and I look forward to what the future holds!
        
            And I love CATS!

        <h2>My Goals in Life</h2>
        <p>I have many aspirations in lifeâ€”personal milestones to reach, a fulfilling career to build, and a purpose-driven life to live. 
            Each goal represents a step toward becoming the best version of myself. 
            However, at this moment, my main focus is overcoming the challenges before me and successfully graduating from my college major. 
            I know that this journey is not just about earning a degree but also about learning, growing, and preparing for the future. 
            With determination and perseverance, I hope to turn my dreams into reality and create a life filled with success, happiness, and purpose.
